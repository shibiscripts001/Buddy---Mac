"""
Resolve Bridge for Time Tracker.
Asynchronously checks which project (if any) is currently open in DaVinci
Resolve, via a short-lived helper subprocess (see resolve_poll_worker.py) -
or, when Buddy was launched from Resolve's Scripts menu, through the
connection Resolve handed it (see poll()), since the free Resolve won't let
that subprocess connect.
See resolve_poll_worker.py's docstring for why this stays deliberately
separate from core/resolve_bridge.py's shared one-shot connection.

QProcess (not subprocess.run) keeps each poll off the Qt main thread so a
slow or hung check never freezes the UI; the actual subprocess spawn+wait
runs on a plain background thread instead (see poll()), since
_no_feedback_cursor_kwargs() below needs subprocess.run/Popen kwargs QProcess
doesn't expose.

There is deliberately no tasklist-based "is Resolve.exe even running"
pre-check gating whether poll() spawns the worker subprocess. It would only
be a micro-optimization (skip the heavier worker when Resolve is obviously
closed), but `tasklist` resolving via a bare command name depends on PATH,
and when Buddy runs from inside Resolve's own script host that lookup can
fail to find a genuinely-running Resolve.exe - short-circuiting every poll
to "offline" even though the shell's own shared connection
(core/resolve_probe_worker.py, which has no tasklist dependency at all)
connects fine. Every poll goes straight to the real worker subprocess,
exactly like that shared probe does on every reconnect - one extra
short-lived process per poll interval, but correct rather than
fast-and-occasionally-wrong.
