"""
Shared DaVinci Resolve connection for the Buddy shell.

connect() below is the ONE place any tool page goes through to get a live
ResolveController - it always probes reachability in a disposable
subprocess first (see resolve_probe_worker.py for why that has to happen
out-of-process), and only imports DaVinciResolveScript in-process,
here, once that probe has confirmed Resolve is actually up. From that
point on, per-action calls (rename a clip, import media, read the current
timeline) go straight through this in-process controller - the fast
path. A crash is a risk only for the FIRST connection attempt, made before
Resolve is confirmed running.

Launched from Resolve's Scripts menu, Resolve hands the script a ready
connection - the `resolve` global Buddy.py passes to set_host_resolve().
That's the only connection the free Resolve allows (scriptapp() from a
menu script returns None there, and so does anything run out-of-process),
so when it's there it's what connect() uses, and the probe subprocess is
skipped: Resolve launched this very process, so it's running.

Every tool-specific need (get_current_clips, import_to_media_pool, etc.)
belongs on a subclass or a helper module next to that tool's page, not
here - this module only owns the connect/bootstrap plumbing every tool
shares.
