"""
Single-instance enforcement for Buddy.

Launching from Resolve's Workspace > Scripts menu spawns a brand new
process every time - with nothing preventing it, opening the menu item
twice (e.g. because the first window was minimized to the tray and easy to
forget about) would start a second Buddy independently polling Resolve for
Time Tracker, silently double-counting or conflicting with the first. A
QLocalServer/QLocalSocket handshake (Qt's own standard mechanism for
exactly this) makes the first instance listen on a well-known local name;
every later launch just pings that name - if something answers, this
process asks it to come to the front and exits immediately without ever
building a window.

For the free Resolve: a launch from Resolve's Scripts menu
holds the connection Resolve handed it, the only kind that Resolve allows
(core/resolve_bridge.py) - and a Buddy left running after its Resolve quit
holds a dead one it can never replace. So such a launch asks to take over:
the running instance steps aside (quitting cleanly, as from the tray) when
its own connection is gone, and just comes to the front when it still works.
