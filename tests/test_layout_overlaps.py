"""No UI overlaps other UI, anywhere, at any window size: every tool (every
tab, and Color Palette's generators), the shell's header and rail with dual
view off and on, and the Settings window with each tool's section - resized
from roomy down to small, in every theme (each has its own fonts and
spacing). An overlap is a box whose content spills over its neighbour, or a
page that scrolls sideways; tests/layout_sweep.py finds them.

The sweep runs in a process of its own with HOME pointed at a throwaway
folder, so no page ever touches the real settings or data (see there)."""
